# It could be an editor
for GTFS shapes, someday... I hope...

## how to "use":

    $ npm install express
    $ npm run serve # a small web-server using express from node.js

I'm coding this editor full-JS to put it on my webserver, then I need something light by now, but I would like to get better stuff at some point
